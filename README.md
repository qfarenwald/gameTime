# Abstract

Our group was tasked with recreating a unique, web version of the TV gameshow 'Family Feud'. In this project we used the following technologies:

- webpack
- SASS
- ES6 (JavaScript)
- HTML

## To install
Clone down this repo 
Then install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see a page with some `h1` text and a pink background. If that's the case, you're good to go. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

### To play the game :

In the terminal, run:

```bash
npm start
```

You will see a bunch of lines output to your terminal. One of those lines will be something like:

```bash
Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
```

Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to view your code running in the browser.
